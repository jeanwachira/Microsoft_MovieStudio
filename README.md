## Business Understanding:
### Problem:

Microsoft has decide they want to create a new studio in which they want to produce original content based on the market favourite, but they are unfarmiliar about creating movies.

## Aim:

According to recent movies in the sites such as IDMB and Box office Mojo we can see the movies that are the most liked in the world are Black panther and Black Adams this are movies that belong to action packed genre in which they incorporate fictional characters where there is a protagonist and an antagonist which have powers and a story about how they came to be .

In order to achive this we need to survey different movie sites that have the information on which types of films to create by assessing what movies are liked and not only that and why thare liked, Hence it will create an easy understanding for Microsoft Studio can generate movies towards the influence of the fan base.
